The results of each PACE challenge are documented in a report that is published in the IPEC proceedings.

- PACE 2018 (report in preparation, [talk](https://bit.ly/PACE2018-talk)): Steiner Tree
- PACE 2017 ([report](https://dx.doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.IPEC.2017.30)): Treewidth and Minimum Fill-In
- PACE 2016 ([report](https://dx.doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.IPEC.2016.30)): Treewidth and Feedback Vertex Set

## Impact

PACE has inspired some great papers:

- Hisao Tamaki. [Positive-instance driven dynamic programming for treewidth](https://dx.doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ESA.2017.68) (ESA 2017, **best paper award**)
- Ben Strasser. [Computing Tree Decompositions with FlowCutter: PACE 2017 Submission](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08949) (arXiv:1709.08949 [cs.DS])
- Max Bannach, Sebastian Berndt and Thorsten Ehlers. [Jdrasil: A Modular Library for Computing Tree Decompositions](https://dx.doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SEA.2017.28) (SEA 2017)
- Serge Gaspers, Joachim Gudmundsson, Mitchell Jones, Julián Mestre and Stefan Rümmele. [Turbocharging Treewidth Heuristics](https://dx.doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.IPEC.2016.13) (IPEC 2016)
