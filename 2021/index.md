## Challenge description

The challenge for this year is **Cluster Editing**:

**Input:** An undirected graph $G = (V, E)$. <br/>
**Output:** A set of edge modifications (addition or deletion) of minimum size that transforms $G$ into a cluster graph.

You can find more details on Cluster Editing [here](cluster-editing/).
