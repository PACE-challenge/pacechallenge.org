## Challenge description

The challenge for this year is **Cluster Editing**:

**Input:** An undirected graph $G = (V, E)$. <br/>
**Output:** A set of edge modifications (addition or deletion) of minimum size that transforms $G$ into a cluster graph.

You can find more details on Cluster Editing [here](cluster-editing/).

## Tracks

As in PACE 2020, we will have one track for **Exact** algorithms and another for **Heuristic** algorithms.
In addition, we will have another track for **Data Reduction** algorithms:

**Exact:**
Your task is to find an optimal solution of each Cluster Editing instance within the time limit of 30 minutes.
You will be ranked by the number of solved instances.

**Heuristic:**
Your task is to find the best solution of each Cluster Editing instance within the time limit of 10 minutes.
You will be ranked by the quality of the solution.

**Kernelization:**
Your task is to find an equivalent instance of each Cluster Editing instance within the time limit of 5 minutes.
You will be ranked by the size of the returned instance.

You can find more details on the ranking methods [here](tracks/).

## Submission

You submit your solver to [optil.io](https://optil.io/) and its description to [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pace2021).
See [submission requirements](submissions/) for details.
