title: "PACE 2023 - Properties of the Exact Benchmark Set"
---

The benchmark set for the exact track has the following properties, which may be utilized by the submitted solvers (but doesn't have to).

## Number of Vertices
The minimum number of vertices is $19$, the maximum number is $20000$. The graphs have $1550$ vertices on average.

## Number of Edges
The minimum number of edges is $46$, the maximum number is $35052$. The graphs have $5596$ edges on average.

## Graph Classes
Roughly $9\%$ of the graphs are planar, $1\%$ is chordal, and $12\%$ are bipartite. The average connectivity of the benchmark set is $6,87$. Each graph has a maximum matching of at least $6$ and of at most $5000$ with an average of $503,665$.
