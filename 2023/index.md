This year's challenge is about
[twinwidth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-width), a graph
parameter that (intuitively) measures the distance of a graph to a
co-graph. The parameter was introduced in
[2020](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9317878) and has lead to
a multitude of theoretical
[results](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/search?q=twin-width) since then.

### Challenge Description

The goal of this year's challenge is to compute a contraction sequence
for a given graph of small width. More precisely: 

**Input:** An *undirected* graph $G=(V,E)$. <br/>
**Output:** A contraction sequence that contracts $G$ to a single
vertex. <br/>
**Measure:** The width of the contraction sequence. 

<em style="color:#db8a00">Details about the input and output format will be made available in October.</em>

### Tracks

As in previous incarnations of the challenge, we will have *two*
tracks: One focusing on **Exact** algorithms and one for **Heuristic**
solutions.

#### The Exact Track
The task is to compute an optimal solution for each given graph, that
is, a contraction sequence of *minimum* width. For each instance, the
solver has to output a solution within a time limit of <em
style="color:#db8a00">$x$</em> minutes.

Submissions should be based on provably optimal algorithms, however,
this is *not* a formal requirement. Submissions that output an
*incorrect* solution or a solution that is known to be *non-optimal*
will be **disqualified**. Besides dedicated algorithms, we also
encourage submissions based on other paradigms such as SAT, MaxSAT,
or ILPs.

<em style="color:#db8a00">The scoring-scheme and the precise value of $x$ will be announced in November.</em>

#### The Heuristic Track

In this track the solver shall compute a *good* solution
*quickly*. The solver will be run on each instance for <em
style="color:#db8a00">$y$</em> minutes and receives the Unix signal
SIGTERM afterwards. When receiving this signal, the process has to
output a correct contraction sequence immediately to the standard
output and terminate. If the program does not halt in a reasonable
time after reserving the signal, it will be stopped via SIGKILL. In
this case the instance is counted as *time limited
exceeded*. Information on how to handle Unix signals in various
programming languages can be found on the [optil.io webpage](https://www.optil.io/optilion/help/signals).

For this track solutions do *not* have to be optimal. However, solvers
that produce *incorrect* solution will be **disqualified**.

### Theory Awareness 

Very little is known about computational aspects of twinwidth. There
is a reasonable effective
[SAT-encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06146) and a proof that it
is already hard to test whether a graph has twinwidth [at most
four](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08953). Since one of the goals of the
challenge is to bridge the gap between theory and practice, we
encourage submissions that are baked with new theoretical
insights. This year's incarnation of the PACE supports this idea in two ways:

1. The instance sets will contain some instances from predefined graph
   classes (such as planar graphs, twinwidth 2 graphs, etc.). Solvers
   can thus specialize, to a certain degree, to specific inputs.
2. We will give an extra **Theory Award** to the submission with the most
   interesting theoretical guarantee that has to be documented in the solver description. 

### Benchmark Sets

There will be three benchmark set:

1. A *tiny set* for debugging that contains graphs together with their
   twinwidth.
   - <em style="color:#db8a00">This set will be made available in October.</em>
2. The *exact set* containing 200 instances divided into 100
   public instances for development and 100 private instances used for
   evaluation.
   - <em style="color:#db8a00">The public instances will be made
     available in December; the private instances after the challenge.</em>
3. The *heuristic set* containing 200 instances divided into 100
   public instances for development and 100 private instances used for evaluation.
   - <em style="color:#db8a00">The public instances will be made
     available in December; the private instances after the challenge.</em>
