## Challenge Description

The challenge for this year is **Directed Feedback Vertex Set**:

**Input:** A directed graph $G = (V, E)$. <br/>
**Output:** Find a minimum subset $X \subseteq V$ such that, when all vertices of $X$ and their adjacent edges are deleted from $G$, the remainder is acyclic.


You can find more details on Directed Feedback Vertex Set [here](directed-fvs/).

## Tracks

We will have one track for **Exact** algorithms and another for **Heuristic** algorithms.

**Exact:**
Your task is to find an optimal solution of each Directed Feedback Vertex Set instance within the time limit of 30 minutes.
You will be ranked by the number of solved instances.

**Heuristic:**
Your task is to find the best solution of each Directed Feedback Vertex Set instance within the time limit of 10 minutes.
You will be ranked by the quality of the solution.

You can find more details on the ranking methods [here](tracks/).

## Submission

You submit your solver to [optil.io](https://optil.io/) and its description to [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pace2022).
See [submission requirements](submissions/) for details.
