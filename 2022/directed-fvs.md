title: "PACE 2022 - Directed Feedback Vertex Set"
---

The Directed Feedback Vertex Set Problem is defined as follows:

**Input:** A directed graph $G = (V, E)$. <br/>
**Output:** Find a minimum subset $X \subseteq V$ such that, when all vertices of $X$ and their adjacent edges are deleted from $G$, the remainder is acyclic.


Thus a feedback vertex set of a graph is a set of vertices whose deletion leaves a graph acyclic.

### Example

![Example](/2022/img/examplemergedscaled.png)

In this example, deleting/removing the red vertex and its edges in the left graph results in the graph on the right hand side and leaves the remaining graph without any cycles.

### Background 

The Directed Feedback Vertex Set Problem has a wide range of applications including deadlock detection, program verification and VLSI chip design.  The problem is NP-complete even if restricted to graphs with maximum in- and out-degree two. The optimization problem can be solved in $O^*(1.9977^n)$ due to an algorithm by Razgon. 
Chen et al. have shown that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable if parameterized with the solution size $k$, i.e. Chen et al. develop an algorithm with running time $4^kk!n^{O(1)}$.
Note that the problem is equivalent to the edge-deletion variant commonly called Feedback Arc Set: there are reductions in both ways that preserve the value of the optimal solution and only blow up the size of the graph (sum of vertices and edges) by a polynomial factor.
