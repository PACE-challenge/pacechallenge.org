title: "PACE 2022 - Directed Feedback Vertex Set"
---

The Directed Feedback Vertex Set Problem is defined as follows:

**Input:** A directed graph $G = (V, E)$ and a positive integer $k$. <br/>
**Output:** Is there a subset $X \subseteq V$ with $|X| \leq k$ such that, when all vertices of $X$ and their adjacent edges are deleted from $F$, the remainder is cycle-free?

Thus a feedback vertex set of a graph is a set of vertices whose deletion leaves a graph cycle-free.

### Example

<p style="clear: both;">

In this example, deleting/removing the red vertex in the left graph and its edges, results in the graph on the right hand side and leaves the remaining graph without any cycles.

### Background 

The Directed Feedback Vertex Set Problem has a wide range of applications including deadlock detection, program verification and VLSI chip design.  The problem is NP-complete even if restricted to graphs with maximum in- and out-degree two. The corresonding optimizion problem, i.e. finding the smallest cardinality feedback vertex set, can be solved in $O^*(1.9977^{|V|})$ due to an algorithm by Razgon. Chen et al. have shown that the problem is fixed-parameter tracktable if parameterized with the solution size $k$, i.e. Chen et al. develop an algorithm with running time $4^kk!n^{O(1)}$.
