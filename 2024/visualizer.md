The visualizer (*coming soon*) can be used to visualize a given instance and solution.

## Usage

To start the visualizer, use the following command:

```console
$ visualizer <path/to/graph.gr> <path/to/solution.sol>
```

The visualizer has three ways to draw the graph:
- Draw 2-sided: draw the given instance in the order provided by the instance file (<path/to/graph.gr>)
- Draw 2-sided solved: draw the given instance in the order provided by the solution file (<path/to/solution.gr>)
- Draw force: draw the given instance with a force-directed algorithm.
