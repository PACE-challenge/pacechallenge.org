This year's challenge is about the one-sided crossing minimization problem (OCM).
This problem involves arranging the nodes of a bipartite graph on two layers (typically horizontal), with one of the layers fixed, aiming to minimize the number of edge crossings.
OCM is one of the basic building block used for drawing [hierarchical graphs](https://doi.org/10.1109%2FTSMC.1981.4308636). It is [NP-hard](https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-3975(94)90179-1), even [for trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15339), but admits good heuristics, can be [constant-factor approximated](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01187020) and solved in [FPT time](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00453-004-1093-2). 
For an extended overview, see [Chapter 13.5 of the Handbook of Graph Drawing](https://cs.brown.edu/people/rtamassi/gdhandbook/chapters/hierarchical.pdf).

### Challenge Description

The goal of this year's challenge is to compute a 2-layered drawing of a bipartite graph, where one side is fixed, with a minimum number of crossings. More precisely: 

**Input:** A bipartite graph $G=((A\dot\cup B),E)$, and a linear order of $A$. <br/>
**Output:** A linear order of $B$. <br/>
**Measure:** The number of edge crossings in a straight-line drawing of $G$ with $A$ and $B$ on two parallel lines, following their linear order.

See an example here with two different linear orders for $B$.

### Tracks

This year, we will have *three* tracks: 
- one focusing on **Exact** algorithms for instances with "few" crossings
- one for **Heuristic** algorithms for instances that might require many crossings
- one for exact **Parameterized** algorithms for instances with small [cutwidth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutwidth).


#### The Exact Track

The task is to compute an optimal solution for each given graph, that
is, a linear order of $B$ that *minimizes the number of crossings*. For each instance, the
solver has to output a solution within a time limit of <em
style="color:#db8a00">30 minutes</em> and a memory limit of <em
style="color:#db8a00">8 GB</em>.

Instances in this track have solutions where the number of crossings 
is smaller than the number of vertices, but we do not 
give explicit bounds.

Submissions should be based on provably optimal algorithms, however,
this is *not* a formal requirement. Submissions that output an
*incorrect* solution or a solution that is known to be *non-optimal*
will be **disqualified**. Besides dedicated algorithms, we also
encourage submissions based on other paradigms such as SAT, MaxSAT,
or ILPs.

#### The Heuristic Track

In this track, the solver shall compute a *good* solution
*quickly*. The solver will be run on each instance for <em
style="color:#db8a00">5 minutes</em> and receives the Unix signal
SIGTERM afterwards. When receiving this signal, the process has to
output a linear order of $B$ immediately to the standard
output and terminate. If the program does not halt in a reasonable
time after reserving the signal, it will be stopped via SIGKILL. In
this case the instance is counted as *time limit exceeded*. 
Information on how to handle Unix signals in various
programming languages can be found on the [optil.io webpage](https://www.optil.io/optilion/help/signals). 
The memory limit for this track is <em style="color:#db8a00">8 GB</em> as well.

For this track solutions do *not* have to be optimal. However, solvers
that produce *incorrect* solution will be **disqualified**.

#### Parameterized Track

This track has the same rules as the Exact Track. 
However, the instances here can require a large number of crossings,
but they have small [cutwidth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutwidth):
there is an ordering of the vertices of the graph, such that every cut obtained by 
partitioning the vertices into earlier and later subsets of the ordering is crossed 
by at most $k$ edges. Note that in this order the vertices of $A$ and $B$ might
be interleaved. An ordering that achieves minimum cutwidth will be provided
together with the graph.


### Benchmark Sets

There will be four benchmark set:

1. A *tiny set* for debugging that contains graphs together with their
   one-sided crossing number. 
   - [instances](./tiny_test_set.zip)
   - [solutions](./tiny_test_set-sol.zip)
   - [images](./tiny_test_set-overview.pdf)
2. The *exact set* containing 200 instances divided into 100
   public instances for development and 100 private instances used for
   evaluation.
3. The *heuristic set* containing 200 instances divided into 100
   public instances for development and 100 private instances used for evaluation.
4. The *parameterized set* containing 200 instances divided into 100
   public instances for development and 100 private instances used for
   evaluation.
