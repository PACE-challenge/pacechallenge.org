The Parameterized Algorithms and Computational Experiments Challenge (PACE) was
conceived in Fall 2015 to deepen the relationship between parameterized algorithms and
practice.
Topics from multivariate algorithms, exact algorithms, fine-grained complexity, and related fields are in scope.

## Our Mission

PACE aims to:

- Bridge the divide between the theory of algorithm design and analysis, and the practice
of algorithm engineering
- Inspire new theoretical developments
- Investigate in how far theoretical algorithms from parameterized complexity and related fields are competitive in practice
- Produce universally accessible libraries of implementations and repositories of benchmark instances
- Encourage the dissemination of these findings in scientific papers
