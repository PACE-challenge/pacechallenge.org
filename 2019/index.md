## Submission 

### Requirements
1. Open Source (e.g. GPL, MIT, or public domain)
2. Source code is available on a public repository (e.g., [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org), [GitHub](https://github.com), [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com))
3. Submissions Solver: Deadline (DS)
   1. Submission via [optil.io](https://www.optil.io/optilion/)
   2. Register solver and participants via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pace2019)
   3. Create a release in the public repository of the solver (name: pace-2019)
4. Submission Description: Deadline (DD)
   1. Place the source code of the solver in a digital library (e.g., [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)) and generate a DOI 
   2. Submit solver description via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pace2019) use DOI to refer to the solver and include a reference to the public source code repository 


#### Solver

- Content of the Repository 
  -  LICENSE.md or LICENSE.txt file at the root
  -  README.md or README.txt file at the root
  -  INSTALL.md or INSTALL.txt file at the root that contains the requirements for external libraries 
      -  Language specific file for easy installation (e.g., *CMakeLists.txt* for cmake or *environment.yaml* for anaconda); the file is not mandatory, however, we encourage to provide it at the time of the submission of the solver description
- Restrictions
  - External Libraries: tba (likely upon request due to optil restrictions)


#### Solver Description
- Latex Style [LIPIcs](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/)
- 2+ pages
- Should briefly describe the used techniques and references to the original publications. 


## Evaluation
tba


Then, to participate, you will just upload your code to the platform optil.io as stated on this page. Current leader board on public instances will be live on optil.io. The final ranking will be done on the private instances, using the last valid submission on public instances on optil.io. We kindly ask the participants to send by email to the PC the name of the participants in the team, the name used on optil.io for each track, a link to the public repository as well as a short description of the program and algorithm.
