---
We are happy to announce that PACE 2018 will cooperate again with
[OPTIL.io](http://optil.io) to handle the submission process and the
evaluation of the submissions. [OPTIL.io](http://optil.io) is a website
for organizing programming challenges on optimization problems, created
and maintained by the [Institute of Computing
Science](http://www2.cs.put.poznan.pl/) of [Poznan University of
Technology](https://www.put.poznan.pl/).

For all the tracks, the participants have the possibility to submit
their code and run it on the 100 public test instances.Â  Due to the
workload, submissions are allowed only once every 24 hours.
There is also a lite version of the public instances in
which the program can be tested on fewer instances and with a shorter
timeout of 5 minutes.

Here are the links for submitting your programs:

- Track A: <https://www.optil.io/optilion/problem/3023>
- Track A lite: <https://www.optil.io/optilion/problem/3026>

- Track B: <https://www.optil.io/optilion/problem/3024>
- Track B lite: <https://www.optil.io/optilion/problem/3027>

- Track C: <https://www.optil.io/optilion/problem/3025>
- Track C lite: <https://www.optil.io/optilion/problem/3028>

If you have any trouble submitting your code, please contact us or the
organizers of Optil.io.

Good luck!
