Thanks to the generous support of the NWO Gravitation project [NETWORKS](http://thenetworkcenter.nl/), we can announce the following awards for the first PACE challenge.

## Competition Prizes

For each of the two tracks we award prizes. Track A offers four ranked challenges: exact sequential, exact parallel, heuristic sequential, and heuristic parallel computation of treewidth. For each ranked challenge, there will be a first, second, and third prize.

- Each first prize will receive 200 €.
- Each second prize will receive 100 €.
- Each third prize will receive 75 €.

Track B offers one ranked challenge and there will be altogether three prizes for this challenge.

- The first prize will receive 500 €.
- The second prize will receive 300 €.
- The third prize will receive 200 €.

The ranking criteria for each challenge are described in the description of each track.

## Travel Awards

Altogether, three travel awards of 500 € will be handed out.

The application deadline is July 20, 2016. To be eligible one must

PhD students), and
- give a commitment to attend [IPEC](http://conferences.au.dk/algo16/ipec/) in case one receives the award.
