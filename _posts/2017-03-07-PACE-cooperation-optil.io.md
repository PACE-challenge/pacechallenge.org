title: "PACE is cooperating with OPTIL.io"
---
March 1 has passed which means that submission is possible from now until May 1 for both tracks of PACE 2017.

We are happy to announce that PACE 2017 will cooperate with [OPTIL.io](http://optil.io) to handle the submission process and the evaluation of submissions. [OPTIL.io](http://optil.io) is a website for organizing programming challenges for optimization problems, created and maintained by the [Institute of Computing Science](http://www2.cs.put.poznan.pl/) of [Poznan University of Technology](https://www.put.poznan.pl/).

## Track A

For Track A, participants have the possibility to submit their code and run it on the 100 public test instances. Due to the workload, submissions are allowed only once every 48 hours. To test the compatibility of your software with the platform, there is also an unlimited ‘lite’ version of the test in which the program can be tested on fewer instances and with a timeout of 30 seconds. The leaderboard at [OPTIL.io](http://optil.io) is independent of the official PACE Track A competition – the evaluation of the final submissions on the hidden instances will happen on the platform that is described on the Track A website.

## Track B

For Track B, participants have the possibility to submit their code and run it on the 100 public test instances and also on the 100 hidden instances which are used for the final evaluation of the challenge. Due to the workload, submissions are allowed only once every 48 hours. As for Track A, there is also an unlimited ‘lite’ version of the test for the public instances in which the program can be tested on fewer instances and with a timeout of 30 seconds. For the hidden instances, we will announce a current leaderboard on this website. This leaderboard will show the current standing according to the competition rules of Track B, the leaderboard at [OPTIL.io](http://optil.io) is independent.
