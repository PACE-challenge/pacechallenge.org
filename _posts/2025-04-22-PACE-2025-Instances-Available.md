title: "PACE 2025: Public Instances are Available on Github"
---

We are happy to announce that the public instances are (finally) on [GitHub](https://github.com/MarioGrobler/PACE2025-instances). Please note that we had to compress the instances for the heuristic tracks in order to stay within the file size limit.
Finally, we would like to give a short update on the current status of [optil](https://www.optil.io/board/): the team behind optil is still working on setting everything up. We expect the preliminary leaderboard to go live in the near future.
