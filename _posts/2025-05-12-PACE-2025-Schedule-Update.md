title: "PACE 2025: Timeline Update and FAQ"
---

We have updated the [timeline](/2025/#timeline). The deadline for the solvers is **Friday, 13.06.2025, 23:59 AOE**. Recall this years procedure to [ensure the correctness of exact solvers](/2025/#evaluation-and-correctness-of-exact-solvers). We have also added a small [FAQ](/2025/#faq).
We expect the preliminary leaderboard on [optil](https://www.optil.io) to go live within the next few days.
Happy Coding!
