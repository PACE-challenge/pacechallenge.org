We are happy to announce the [results of PACE 2020](/2020/results/). Congratulations to the winners and all the participants. You are great!

We also updated the [challenge description page](/2020/td/) and you can download private instances there.

We can also confirm now that up to 10 solver descriptions will appear in the [IPEC](http://apsec2012.comp.polyu.edu.hk/) proceedings. The Programme Committee will select accepted descriptions by July 31. We will ask the authors of accepted descriptions to provide camera-ready versions by August 31.
