title: "PACE 2025: Solver Description Deadline and current status"
---

Dear all, as the solver description deadline is approaching, we would like to give an update on the current state.
We have added a bunch of test instances to the [instances repository](https://github.com/MarioGrobler/PACE2025-instances). Note that these instances are not the private instances and hence not used for scoring. However, exact solvers producing suboptimal or invalid solution on *any* instance (and hence on any of these test instances) will be disqualified. Half of the instances are taken from the [Stride](https://domset.algorithm.engineering/) dataset (thanks to Manuel Penschuck for this project!) while the other half are small and random graphs. We refer to the readme file in the repository for further information.
Note that we have added two late submissions to the list of [participating solvers](/2025/submissions). We have carefully verified that the codebases of those solvers have not been modified after the deadline in order to ensure fairness.
