title: "PACE 2020: Repository with all PACE 2020 instances"
---

We created a [repository](https://github.com/lkowalik/Treedepth-PACE-2020-instances) which contains all our (public and private) instances. Enjoy! Each instance file has comment lines with instance type (e.g. biology, social networks), origin and description. We hope that the repo will be useful for future PACE organizers and for researchers working in algorithm engineering.
