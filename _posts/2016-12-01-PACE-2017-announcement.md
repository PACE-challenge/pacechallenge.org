title: "PACE 2017 Announcement"
---
We are happy to announce the second iteration of PACE, the Parameterized Algorithms and Computational Experiments Challenge. The goal of PACE is to investigate the applicability of algorithmic ideas studied and developed in the subfields of multivariate, fine-grained, parameterized, or fixed-parameter tractable algorithms. The challenge consists of two separate tracks.

## Track A (Treewidth Challenges)

1) Compute a tree-decomposition of minimum width. You have 30 minutes per instance. Win by solving more instances than the other participants.

2) Compute some tree-decomposition. You have 30 minutes per instance. Win by printing solutions of smaller width than the other participants.

Detailed instructions and fresh instance sets:

## Track B (Minimum Fill-In Challenge)

Given an undirected graph G, compute a smallest set of edges E such that adding E to G results in a chordal graph. You have 30 minutes per instance. Win by solving more instances than the other participants.

Detailed instructions and an instance set:
