We have prepared a *preliminary* set of 50 instances for the exact track of the Dominating Set Challenge. Find them on [GitHub](https://github.com/MarioGrobler/PACE2025-instances). For both problems, we plan to add a full set of 100 instances for the exact track as well as a full set of 100 instances for the heuristic track by the end of february.
