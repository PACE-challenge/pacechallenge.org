title: "PACE 2020 Call for Participation"
---

We are happy to announce the fifth iteration of PACE, the Parameterized Algorithms and Computational Experiments Challenge. The goal of PACE is to investigate the applicability of algorithmic ideas studied and developed in the subfields of multivariate, fine-grained, parameterized, or fixed-parameter tractable algorithms. 

This year, the challenge is on **treedepth**:

- **Input:**  A connected undirected graph $G=(V,E)$
- **Output:**  A treedepth decomposition of $G$

Let us recall that a *treedepth decomposition* of a connected graph $G=(V,E)$ is a rooted tree $T=(V,E_T)$ such that every edge of $G$ connects a pair of nodes that have an ancestor-descendant relationship to each other in $T$. The *depth* of $T$ is the maximum number of nodes in a root-vertex path in $T$. The *treedepth* of $G$ is a minimum depth of a treedepth decomposition of $G$.

## Tracks

Two tracks are planned:

 1. **Exact**: compute a treedepth decomposition of minimum depth. You have 30 minutes per instance.  Contestants are ranked by number of instances solved and time required. Exact ranking method will be published online.
 2.  **Heuristic**: compute some treedepth decomposition of decent depth. You have 30 minutes per instance. Contestants are ranked by quality of results and time required. Exact ranking method will be published online.

Detailed instructions and public instances will be published later (see Timeline below)

## Prizes
Thanks to the generous sponsoring of the [NETWORKS project](https://pacechallenge.org/2019/vc/) and [data-experts.de](https://data-experts.de), a total of 4750 Euro of prize money and travel support is available for the winners of the competition.
