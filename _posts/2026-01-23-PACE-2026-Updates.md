title: "PACE 2026: Track details and instances"
---

Dear all,
the detailed [specification of all tracks](https://pacechallenge.org/2026/#scoring) is now online.
The exact and heuristic tracks are very similar to the previous iterations.
The new "lower-bound" track is a blend between both: we ask for submissions of solvers that guarantee a prescribed solution quality as fast as possible.

Unfortunately, we are behind schedule with the generation of public instances. 
We expect to publish the instances in February and apologise for the delay.

In the meantime, we recommend using the [STRIDE tool](https://pacechallenge.org/2026/#stride) which already contains several thousand instances of varying difficulty.
Some of these instances are constructed using tools similar to the public instances (although possibly with different parameters).
We plan to add further instances to STRIDE over time and also invite the community to send interesting instances to [Manuel](https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/en/persons/manuel-penschuck/).
The STRIDE database already contains many (often optimal) solution scores, and additional solutions are added while you test your solver.
