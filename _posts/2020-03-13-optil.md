title: "PACE 2020: both tracks are running at optil.io"
---

We are happy to announce that you can now submit your solutions to optil.io.
Let us recall that the final deadline for submission is June, 1. 
Until the submission deadline, you will be able to test your solution on public instances and see unofficial rankings.
Please note that the ranking published at optil.io is only auxiliary. In particular:

- the ranking at optil.io is created using public instances only. The final ranking will be generated using private instances.
- in the final ranking for the exact track, the solutions which return an incorrect result for some test instance will be disqualified (this is not supported by the optil.io ranking.

Please note that in both tracks you can submit only *once* in 24 hours. The optil.io team has also prepared **lite versions** of both tracks, with just three test instances, but with no limit on the number of submissions. You can use them for test submission, e.g. to make sure that your solution compiles on the optil.io server, whether you included all the files, etc.
